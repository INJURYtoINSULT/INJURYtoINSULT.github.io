            I love programming. So much so, that on top of my studies, it is my favorite hobby. Frequently when working on math problems, I come up with two solutions, a mathematical one and a programmatic one.<br><br>
            I have experience with numerous languages: Python, C, Java, Javascript, and more.
            In addition to this, I am familiar with GitHub, SQL, Linux, and am generally quick to learn anything technology oriented.<br><br>
            If you're curious about any of the work I've done, here is my <a href="https://github.com/INJURYtoINSULT" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> <br>
            I also enjoy coding challenges on CodeWars; I enjoy both realistic, pragmatic solutions, and strange oneliners. Here is my <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/LenixC" target="_blank">CodeWars account.</a><br>

            <p id="math-text">Studying mathematics has taught me how to learn in a diverse and fast paced environment. <br>
                Each day, I study a wide variety of subjects, from computability theory, to combinatorics, to differential equations and more. <br>
                I believe that in many ways, coming from a mathematical background has given me a much stronger sense of problem solving and explanations thereof.
