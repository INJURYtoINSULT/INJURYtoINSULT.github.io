        <p>
            My experience with mathematics has made me an incredibly effective problem solver. I am able to quickly
            map out a structure and relate it to a variety of mathematical fields. Though my central interest is in
            logic and computability, I have knowledge in differential equations, combinatorics, linear algebra, and
            much more.
        </p>
        <h2 id="code">def coder:</h2>
        <p>
            I have been coding in some form or another since I was about 10 years old. The first language I picked up
            was Python, and have since studied multiple languages from C to Assembly to Rust to Java. I have a natural
            ability to pick up languages with ease and a solid understanding of many theoretical computer science
            concepts.
        </p>
        <h2 id="lead">leadership</h2>
        <p>
            Since I have been in college, I have made it a duty of mine to get involved in as many on campus activities
            as I can. Through this I have found the Honors program and its Student Honors Council. I ran successfully
            for Vice President and through this process I have learned leadership skills and have been offered many
            opportunities to improve further, from Student Leadership Academies to other on campus clubs.
