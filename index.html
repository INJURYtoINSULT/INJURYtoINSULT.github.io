            I love programming. So much so, that on top of my studies, it is my favorite hobby. Frequently when working on math problems, I come up with two solutions, a mathematical one and a programmatic one.<br><br>
            I have experience with numerous languages: Python, C, Java, Javascript, and more.
            In addition to this, I am familiar with GitHub, SQL, Linux, and am generally quick to learn anything technology oriented.<br><br>
            If you're curious about any of the work I've done, here is my <a href="https://github.com/INJURYtoINSULT" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> <br>
            I also enjoy coding challenges on CodeWars; I enjoy both realistic, pragmatic solutions, and strange oneliners. Here is my <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/LenixC" target="_blank">CodeWars account.</a><br>

            <p id="math-text">Studying mathematics has taught me how to learn in a diverse and fast paced environment. <br>
                Each day, I study a wide variety of subjects, from computability theory, to combinatorics, to differential equations and more. <br>
                I believe that in many ways, coming from a mathematical background has given me a much stronger sense of problem solving and explanations thereof.

                Here's some gifs from my pet project of the moment. It is inspired by the combat mechanics of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. <br>
                Forgive the unpolished look. I just got started with Unreal and I am more focused on making stuff work than making it pretty.
